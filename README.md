# Glioblastoma 3D Segmentation

The goal of this project is to train an accurate 3D Neural Network for Glioblastoma Tumor Segmentation using a limited dataset. To this end, we make use of Patch-Learning. Our work combines the BraTS21 winning U-Net design : [Optimized U-Net for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03352) and the BraTS20 winning learning approach : [nnU-Net for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00848).
